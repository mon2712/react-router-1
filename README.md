The goal of this challenge is to make an App with five routes matching the next urls.

- Home - /
- About me - /about_me

## Guidelines

- Install react-router dependency with `yarn add react-router-dom`. You can read a bit more of react-router [here](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/getting-started/installation) 
- You should have a folder in src/ called `pages` with all the pages you need.
- You should use the component Link from the library.
- The 404 page should appear everytime you try to enter a url it does not exist.
